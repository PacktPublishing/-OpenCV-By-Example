**Enhance your understanding of Computer Vision and image processing by developing real-world projects in OpenCV 3 **

## What is this book about?
Open CV is a cross-platform, free-for-use library that is primarily used for real-time Computer Vision and image processing. It is considered to be one of the best open source libraries that helps developers focus on constructing complete projects on image processing, motion detection, and image segmentation.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Install OpenCV 3 on your operating system 
Create the required CMake scripts to compile the C++ application and manage its dependencies 
Get to grips with the Computer Vision workflows and understand the basic image matrix format and filters 
Understand the segmentation and feature extraction techniques 
Remove backgrounds from a static scene to identify moving objects for video surveillance 
Track different objects in a live video using various techniques 
Use the new OpenCV functions for text detection and recognition with Tesseract

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
// OpenCV includes
#include "opencv2/core.hpp"
#include "opencv2/highgui.hpp"
using namespace cv;
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a software developer with a basic understanding of Computer Vision and image processing and want to develop interesting Computer Vision applications with Open CV, this is the book for you. Knowledge of C++ is required.
